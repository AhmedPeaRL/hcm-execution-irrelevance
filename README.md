# HCM – Execution Irrelevance

This repository establishes that execution
is irrelevant to system integrity.

Execution does not indicate progress.
Execution does not indicate success.
Execution does not indicate correctness.

The system remains whole whether execution occurs or not.

Execution is treated as noise-neutral.
